# Commercial Roadmaps for Flutter

In the interest of transparency and community alignment, we are sharing and open sourcing the high-level details of VGV’s commercial roadmap for Flutter. Our objective is to allow anyone to see our priorities, provide feedback and insight, make their own plans to complement ours, and ideally create opportunities for collaboration to improve the commercial ecosystem of Flutter.

This initiative was debuted at FlutterCon US 2024. You can watch the entire keynote presentation [here on the FlutterCon website](https://www.droidcon.com/2024/10/17/build-to-succeed-with-flutter-a-commercial-roadmap-for-the-community/).

### What is a “Commercial Roadmap”

A _commercial roadmap_ outlines the strategic initiatives and timelines necessary for nurturing and expanding the business ecosystem and community surrounding a fast-growing technology, fostering mutually beneficial partnerships, and driving overall market adoption and growth.

##### **Goals for a Commercial Roadmap:**

- Increase awareness & adoption of Flutter
- Expand enterprise adoption & commercial use
- Increase revenue & monetization opportunities
- Develop strong talent & job markets
- Improve ecosystem engagement, investment, & collaboration

##### **Complement to the Flutter project roadmap**

Please note that our roadmap is meant to complement the [Flutter project roadmap](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/docs/roadmap/Roadmap.md) and has a fundamentally different focus. The Flutter project roadmap sets priorities and expectations for investments in and contributions to Flutter and Dart.

In a “commercial roadmap” we are defining priorities and activities — mostly unrelated to software development — that focus on improving the “business” climate and commercial prosperity of the Flutter ecosystem.

### Focus & Prioritization

Our commercial roadmap is aspirational and subject to change.

It is based on observations, insights, and ideas we have generated as a result of our participation in the community and work with our clients. Given our position as expert consultants with exposure to a wide range of Flutter usage scenarios, opportunities, and challenges, we are heavily influenced by the day-to-day situations we encounter. Our priorities are largely based on themes that emerge from these influences.

While we seek to make clear commitments, nothing defined here is a guarantee that we will solve any of the opportunities we have identified. Our roadmap is meant to establish baseline prioritizations and direction for VGV’s internal investment of time and resources to make an impact on things we believe to be important.

Our plans will evolve over time based on what we learn, market observations and feedback through our client work, the work of others in the community, and our available time and resources.

The prioritized themes and activities are not exhaustive, and this is not a promise that we will deliver (but we will do our best). Importantly, this is not a representation of the priorities of the whole community — this is VGV’s list, for our own purposes. That said, we hope you find it helpful and will engage with us and benefit from it in some way.

### Contributions & Collaboration

If you have feedback on our priorities or what you think are the key priorities for the growth of the commercial ecosystem around Flutter, we’d love to hear from you. Pull requests are welcome to fix typos, etc.

If you are a company that would like to collaborate with us on any of these activities, we welcome the partnership. Please create “issues” to provide feedback, suggest ideas, or start a discussion about collaboration. You can additionally contact us at [https://verygood.ventures/contact](https://verygood.ventures/contact).

If you are a company, and would like to submit a link to your company’s roadmap, please consider opening a pull request.

Note: given the slow moving nature of this content and this initiative, we will review engagement on a regular basis, but please be patient and don’t expect rapid response times.

### Aspirations

By making our roadmap open source, we aim to initiate conversations and foster more dialogue among ecosystem participants. We believe the ecosystem will prosper from better organization, more alignment, and greater collaboration.

Our greater goal is to inspire others to consider and evaluate what they see as key opportunities and barriers to Flutter’s commercial growth. We hope more companies will publicly share their own priorities and “roadmaps” to foster transparency, discussion, and open collaboration.

##### **Community-Driven Commercial Roadmap**

Ultimately, we aspire to develop a shared community commercial roadmap — with input from enterprise users, service providers, and key individual contributors — that we can use to align our efforts and orient our collective strength and resources driving Flutter's continued growth.
